## Organized Crimes Among North American Institutes

I care about few topics within the subject of international geo-politics, and that too, only on weekends. On other days, I spend my efforts in chipping away at various [treacheries being orchestrated by seemingly trustworthy institutes and agencies in North America.](https://github.com/true-hindsight/long-overdue-justice?tab=readme-ov-file#3-violations-of-workers-intellectual-property-and-moral-rights-via-north-american-universities) Not all of those institutes and agencies are corrupt, and not all members among those corrupt organizations are willful wrongdoers. 

An example of a feckless stall tactic, that could be propped up by wrongful institutes from America and Canada, might sound something like this: 

>"Upon establishing the particulars of the Intellectual Properties (IP) belonging to certain international students and workers, that were misappropriated by various and several North American institutes or agencies, we are unable to appraise the present day value of those IP. We are therefore unable to move forward with building a process towards repaying the debt and reparations owed to victims and survivors of those thefts and infringements." 

The first building block of the process towards providing proper remedies to wronged persons in this matter, is for each culpable state-sponsored entity or institute in North America, to publicly admit guilt for their role in infringing the IP and moral rights belonging to students and workers of several countries. This would require all records pertaining to employment contracts of all workers hired or employed at those institutes to be open-sourced, and fully disclosed to the public. The willful theft orchestrated by North American institutes over a period of decades, in robbing students, scholars, and hired staff of their equities, by infringing their respective IP and moral rights, isn't the disputed matter here; the dispute appears to be caused by the unwillingness of the heads of those institutes in dutifully taking up the responsibility for rectifying the culture and values of their institutes, without shoring up denials and resorting to defensive maneuvering.   

Indeed, the leadership and management of those institutes hasn't voluntarily shown repentance and contrition in admitting to their wrongdoings. And in all likelihood, they will not bother to rectify their bad behaviors, and make all necessary amends for their systematic acts of cheating and defrauding international students and workers, until and unless those leaders and managers among corrupt institutes are ordered to, and then made to do so, by "a higher authority", or by "a forcing function."  

This matter needs to be resolved fully and properly, to the satisfaction of all the students and workers who have been wronged or injured by North American institutes, sooner rather than later. So, would you like to keep stalling, delaying, repelling, or otherwise pretending to be ignorant, till the required force to compel you to do the right thing in the best interest of equitable justice favoring those students and workers, materializes at North American shores?
