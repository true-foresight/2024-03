## The Economics of Catastrophe Bonds and War Bonds

>climate_change + inflation + recession + reconstruction_costs

Reconstruction after a natural calamity is more expensive than new construction costs in seemingly barren lands because clearing debris, retrofitting building structures, increased insurance premiums, and the process of doing landscaping on a large-scale area after a disaster, become an added burden to impacted home owners. For many, the only affordable option is to abandon their home, and move away. Of course, moving away, isn't the same as, moving on. But where will Canadians be able to move away to, from imminent Category 5 calamities, and an incoming war to North American mainland? More specifically, ["Do Canadian lives matter?"](https://duckduckgo.com/?hps=1&q=%22do+canadian+lives+matter%3F%22&ia=web) 

Oh! And do I know anything about Search Engine Optimization, foreshadowing, or forecasting? Do I?

If you suppose Canadians from Ontario and Newfoundland will be able to move to places like Calgary and Edmonton, think again. Edmonton, is the linchpin of Canada's crude oil industry. It would be the primary target for being turned into a nuclear waste-ground at the bottom of a radioactive crater because of a barrage of intercontinental and hyper-sonic, nuclear weapons of mass destruction. The radioactive fallout would waft throughout the Arctic because of the Polar Vortex, and even cause radioactive rain and ash-fall in places like Texas. Yes, radioactive precipitation does indeed sound much worse than acid rain, doesn't it? 

With the American sponsored cluster munitions having reached Eastern Europe, and all other substantive support from the US to Ukraine having been shelved, the war between Russia and NATO is only going to get ugly; uglier than the Napoleonic Wars, and much uglier than the previous World Wars because there are many more lives at stake than ever before, in densely packed cities of Europe and North America. Metropolitan cities and populated towns with factories and industries, can be completely obliterated due to wars springing up in every continent and escalating over conflicts for fossil fuels and potable water; and due to a whole lot more things to destroy those cities with, using armaments and weapons of mass destruction having already been amassed and stockpiled by numerous countries around the globe.  

Russia isn't merely staving off Ukraine. The current situation in Europe's Eastern Front, isn't that of Ukraine being equally matched with the military capabilities of Russia, the current situation is that of NATO being significantly under-matched, but not yet overwhelmed, by the full-fledged capabilities of Russia and China. 

What are the rest of the countries of this world supposed to do? They ought to learn from Switzerland's and Norway's roles during World Wars I and II, and not get turned into Laos, Serbia, or Haiti. 

Also, it was indeed banks and institutes from countries like Switzerland, and other war financiers with their hedge funds for [Catastrophe Bonds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjtgltYKmeM) and War Bonds, that would have come out on top financially, regardless of the outcomes of the previous World Wars, as they will, in the aftermath of future wars and calamities, while the rest of the world continues to disintegrate.
